## ðŸ’« Overview
Farmstand is a simple website built using MongoDB, Express.js, and EJS. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) farm products.

## ðŸª„ Features

- Display a list of all farm products
- Create new farm products
- Update existing farm products
- Delete farm products
- Filter products by category (fruit, vegetable, dairy)

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- MongoDB (localhost) for data storage
- Express.js for routing and server management
- EJS for templating and rendering dynamic content
- JavaScript for client-side scripting

## ðŸ“ƒ Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains the Product model definition
- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering dynamic content
- `seeds.js`: Contains initial product data for seeding the database
- `index.js`: The main application file, responsible for routing and server management
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone (link unavailable)`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Seed the database: `node seeds.js`
4. Start the server: `node index.js`
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/products`

## ðŸ—ƒ Scope 

- This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for production use.
- User authentication is not implemented, so anyone can create, update, or delete products.
- The project uses a local MongoDB instance, so data is stored on the local machine.
